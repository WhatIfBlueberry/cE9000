# 3D Ising Model Simulation
This project is dedicated to the simulation of a 3D Ising Model. The Ising Model, named after physicist Ernst Ising, is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics. It describes a system of dipole particles, each of which has a spin that can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). These particles are arranged in a lattice, allowing each particle to interact with its neighbors.

In this 3D simulation, we extend the traditional 2D Ising Model into three dimensions, providing a more complex and realistic representation of magnetic materials. The simulation allows us to observe interesting phenomena such as phase transitions and explore the effects of temperature on the system's overall magnetization.
